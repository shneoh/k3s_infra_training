# K3s Infrastructure Track Labs for Qinetics

Welcome to the hands-on lab repository for the **K3s Infrastructure Track Training**. This training is structured over 3 days and contains a series of practical labs to help you master Kubernetes cluster operations, monitoring, service mesh, and disaster recovery using K3s and Linkerd.

## 🚀 How to Access Your Lab Environment

Each participant will be provided access to their own Kubernetes cluster, hosted on a dedicated virtual environment.

### 🔐 SSH Access

Use the following SSH format to connect to your assigned lab environment:

```bash
ssh droot@ssh.stuXX.steven.asia
````

> Replace `XX` with your assigned student number.
> The password will be given to you during the training session.

### 👥 Student-to-Cluster Mapping

| Student Name | SSH Host                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Student 1    | `droot@ssh.stu01.steven.asia` |
| Student 2    | `droot@ssh.stu02.steven.asia` |
| Student 3    | `droot@ssh.stu03.steven.asia` |
| Student 4    | `droot@ssh.stu04.steven.asia` |
| Student 5    | `droot@ssh.stu05.steven.asia` |
| Student 6    | `droot@ssh.stu06.steven.asia` |
| Student 7    | `droot@ssh.stu07.steven.asia` |

Each cluster is isolated, and you’ll have full `sudo` access via the `droot` account to complete the exercises in this repository.
