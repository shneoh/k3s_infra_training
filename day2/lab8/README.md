# Lab 08: Kibana & Alerting rules 

## üåü Objective

In this lab, you will configure Kibana. You will generate an Elastic Agent from Kibana and deploy it into your K3s environment to collect Kubernetes metrics and logs. These logs will be used for system observation, visualization, and creating alert rules for node health

---

## üîß Prerequisites

Ensure the following before proceeding:

1. **Elasticsearch and Kibana are installed and running**
2. **K3s cluster is operational and accessible**
3. **kubectl is configured and working**
4. **Internet access from the nodes (for pulling Elastic Agent)**

## üß† Step-by-Step Instructions
