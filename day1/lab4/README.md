# 🧪 Lab 4: Traefik Customization & HTTPS with Cert-Manager + Let's Encrypt

## 🎯 Objective

In this lab, you'll customize the default Traefik Ingress controller in your K3s cluster to automatically issue and manage TLS certificates for your apps using **cert-manager** and **Let's Encrypt**.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- A working K3s cluster with Traefik installed (default).
- DNS wildcard domain: `*.app.stuXX.steven.asia` pointing to your LB public IP.
- Access to the K3s cluster via `kubectl`.
- Internet access from your cluster nodes.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Install cert-manager

Apply the cert-manager YAML manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

Check that all cert-manager pods are up:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
```

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Create a ClusterIssuer (Let's Encrypt Staging)


```bash
kubectl apply -f clusterissuer-staging.yaml
```

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Deploy a Sample App

Create a namespace and deploy an nginx app:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo-app
kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx -n demo-app
kubectl expose deployment web --port=80 --target-port=80 -n demo-app
```

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Create a Traefik Middleware to enable http to httpd redirect

Apply the middleware:

```bash
kubectl apply -f middleware-traefik.yaml
```
---

## 🧩 Step 5: Create an Ingress with TLS

Apply the ingress:

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-ingress.yaml
```

---

## ✅ Step 6: Verify Certificate Issuance

Check the certificate status:

```bash
kubectl get certificate -n demo-app
kubectl describe certificate web-tls -n demo-app
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://web.app.stuXX.steven.asia
```

If everything is successful, you should see the **nginx welcome page** served over HTTPS with a valid certificate (from Let's Encrypt staging).

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)

```bash
kubectl delete ns demo-app
kubectl delete clusterissuer letsencrypt-staging
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- This lab uses Let's Encrypt **staging** environment to avoid rate limits during testing.
